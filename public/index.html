            <h2>Housing Price Index (HPI)</h2>
            <p>
                The House Price Index (HPI) is a broad measure of the movement
                of single-family property prices in the United States. Aside
                from serving as an indicator of house price trends, it also
                functions as an analytical tool for estimating changes in the
                rates of mortgage defaults, prepayments, and housing
                affordability. The HPI is one of many economic indicators that
                investors use to keep a pulse on broader economic trends and
                potential shifts in the stock market. Hence, it is essential to
                study the variations and trends in HPI data over the years
                across the US states. We wanted to create a tool to simplify the
                process of studying this data using the US map as the base and a
                color gradient to indicate ranges of HPI.

            <h2>About the Visualization</h2>
            <p>
                The visualization above shows the state-wise HPI for a given
                year based on a gradient. On hovering, a state will get
                highlighted and a popup text box will show its full name. On
                clicking on a state, a graph will appear showing the timeline of
                HPI value for that state. You can use the text entry box to
                search for a year and quarter to update the map and color
                gradient to correspond to that particular year.
